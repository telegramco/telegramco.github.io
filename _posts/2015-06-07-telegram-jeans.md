They're here! After a year of work, refinement, design, and collaboration, we're proud to finally launch [Telegram jeans](http://telegram-co.com/products/telegram-jeans). Made in small runs in our factory here in Brooklyn, our jeans are a modern, skinny cut constructed from imported Japanese denim.

All the details are right, and they're right on-point: leather back patch with gold detailing, chainstitched waistband and hem, antiqued copper hardware.

We're also offering free shipping inside the continental US, and a limited run of [black jeans](http://telegram-co.com/products/telegram-jeans-black
) as well.

Check them out [here](http://telegram-co.com/) and let us know what you think!
