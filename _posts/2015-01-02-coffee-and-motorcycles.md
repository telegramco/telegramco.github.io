There is a coffee-shop a few blocks away from me that sells two things: coffee, and motorcycles. I'm not kidding -- the coffee is strong, the motorcycles are loud, and the patrons love it.

What's the difference between a cup of coffee and a motorcycle? (How is a raven like a writing desk?). You could say it's a matter of degree, the idea that both create a sense of speed, energy, and rustic individualism. You could even go further, since with a lot of commodities -- coffee, say, or [denim](http://telegram-co.com), it's not just about the product, but the story behind it. "A good story will make even the best offer even better," as the saying goes.

And by selling these two things -- a $3 cup of coffee, and a $9000 motorcycle, they seem to make a living.

If only we could all be so cleanly satisfied.
