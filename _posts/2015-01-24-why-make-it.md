Does what you're making already exist?  
Why make music when there's already so much music?  
Does the world really need another jeans company?  
If what you're making already exists in the world, why make it at all? 

But there's a succinct answer: because nobody has done it quite right yet.

Personally, I was into denim.  
I wanted a jean that was skinny enough to shock but not to bewilder.  
I wanted a jean that was well-made, but not overly stiff.  
I wanted a jean that represented a piece of New York, not anywhere else.  
I wanted a jean that fit well but wouldn't.... 

So I made it. [Japanese denim skinny jeans](http://telegram-co.com/), cut and sewn in Brooklyn. Check it out!
