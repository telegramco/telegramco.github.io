At [Telegram Co](http://telegram-co.com/) we're gearing up for launch. Our product is simple, but even the simplest things go to hell when you're not looking.

Being prepared takes time and effort. A restaurant will soft open, a website may be invite-only, a product may sell out its first run (if you're lucky) or just sit on the shelves (if you're not).

What are you prepared for?

 * Prepared in business. Prepared for that meeting, or that client pitch
 * Prepared in art. Prepared to get on stage, to play music or talk or hang your paintings in a gallery.
 * Prepared to put yourself out there. To show your product to the world and see who bites.
 
 I was reading an interview with Shayne Oliver the other day, and one thing stuck out at me:
 
 > "It was more of a concept at first," Shayne Oliver says of his outrageously inventive clothing line Hood By Air, which began in 2006 with a set of droll graphic t-shirts. "The tees would say ‘HOOD.' They were something we'd rock around town, almost to be obnoxious. We'd be running around wearing heels with parts down the middle of our hair, but wearing these t-shirts that said ‘Hood,' just to mix it up. I'd sometimes get into altercations with people over [the shirts], but at least I knew there was power in something I made." ([source](http://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/hood-by-air-shayne-oliver/))
 
The power is in doing something remarkable. In making people stand up and take notice.
