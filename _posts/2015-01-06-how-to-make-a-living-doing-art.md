What does it take to make a living doing art? There's this Ira Glass quote:

"Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you."

And of course art isn't just visual art, but anything you make -- if you make music, or write novels, or design clothes or write programs, the sentiment is the same. There's a sense of 'taste' but you have to push past it, to get to what you're good at.

The counterpart to that big quote is Kevin Kelly's [1000 true fans](http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/). The idea that with the rise of the Internet, you don't need a giant audience or a great big megaphone anymore. You just need a small group of people who care about what you're making. Who care a _lot_ about what you're making

Which is what we're trying to do at [Telegram](http://telegram-co.com/). We're trying to make one thing at a time and do it well. And if you're interested, maybe you'd like to [join us](http://telegram-co.com/pages/newsletter).
