There is a book I read recently on [Wabi-sabi](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0981484603/?tag=ibleedneon-20). It is itself a piece of wabi-sabi: soft cardboard cover, beautifully starched (but imperfect) pages, and a rough-cut edge to it.

Wabi-sabi is the opposite of modernist design. Apple would never allow this kind of imperfection. But it's a different kind of perfect: the perfect of your grandfather's pocket-knife, or a motorcycle jacket that's been ridden across the US and back.

The perfect that comes from wear. From the kinds of things that get better with time, and not worse.

An iPhone from three years ago is an old iPhone. A motorcycle jacket from three years ago is just getting started.
