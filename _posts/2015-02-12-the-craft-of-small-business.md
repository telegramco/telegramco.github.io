There was great article in the New Yorker recently about the craft of small businesses:

> [S]mall breweries came back. Their beers were not better advertised and certainly not better priced. Rather, the crafts went after an enormous blind spot for the big breweries—namely, flavor. I don’t entirely mean to be snide; more precisely, craft beer succeeded by opting not to compete directly, instead pursuing what can be called a “true differentiation” strategy. That means they established a product that, in the mind of the consumer, is markedly and undeniably different (as opposed to “false differentiation,” which is more or less the same thing with different packaging). True differentiation, if it works, actually changes consumer preferences. The dedicated craft-beer drinker, once he’s hooked, no longer cares if Coors Light costs three dollars less.

As [Telegram Jeans](http://telegram-co.com/) are getting off the ground, we'd like to think that we're differentiated in the fact that we're small. We're not some big manufacturer or corporate conglomerate. We're just a few people who care intensely about the product we put out. We care enough about the product that every pair of jeans we put out is handmade, whether you call it "craft" or "small batch" or whatever buzzword you want.
