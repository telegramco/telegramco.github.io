How good are your tools?  
Are they the best, or the most functional?  
Are they simple or complex?  
Are they expensive or cheap?  

In terms of writing or sketching, my requirements are pretty simple:

* Cahier-style notebooks, either by [Moleskine](http://www.amazon.com/dp/8883704983/?tag=telegramco-20) or [Muji](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IQU75AE/?tag=telegramco-20). One advantage of living in New York is that there are three or four Muji stores in Manhattan, each with stacks upon stacks of wonderful Japanese stationery.
* Black pens. No other color will do. [Le Pen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DV6EHLS/?tag=telegramco-20) for felt-tip, or [Bic Velocity](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AQNW3/?tag=telegramco-20) for ballpoint.
* Mechanical pencil. Because having to sharpen a pencil is so twentieth-century. I use the simple [Sharpwriter](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IEE4/?tag=telegramco-20), like you would use in drafting class in grade school.
* White [artist's erasers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001Q4HQVU/?tag=telegramco-20). Because when you erase something, it should be GONE.

There's also this weird effect where buying nice notebooks seems to increase the quality and quantity of your ideas ("I have this wonderful notebook, now I should fill it with something"), but if the notebook is TOO nice then you never end up writing in it ("This Moleskine cost $20, hell if I'm putting my amateur scratchings in it").

For [Telegram](http://telegram-co.com/) these tools gave me great results. The logo, initial concept, details, and fit were all sketched out with mechanical pencil before being drawn "for real" in Illustrator.
