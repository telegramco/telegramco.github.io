A good pair of jeans is hard to find, because for all the companies that make them, very few put in the legwork for both a very good fit and very fine materials. There are many "expensive" pairs, but there are fewer truly well-made pairs.

For [Telegram](http://telegram-co.com/) we're only doing one cut to start, and that's a skinny cut made of Japanese denim.

Skinny jeans have been a part the "leading edge" of culture for decades now, and it's remarkable how well this look has held up. (Especially when paired with a [nice leather jacket](http://telegramstyle.com/2015/02/02/the-appeal-of-the-beaten-up-leather-jacket.html) and bedhead-style hair). Let's recap:

Why skinny jeans? Everyone has their own tastes, and natural variation in body proportions mean that cuts from some manufacturers look great on some but hideous on others. But for those of reasonably slim build, a narrow cut fits the bill just right.

One thing we found when designing and cutting our own jeans was that a lot of companies get it wrong. They either make the jean out of very rigid denim (which is too hard to move around in) or very elastic denim (which doesn't wear as well as pure cotton). For Telegram we looked for a happy medium between these two -- we found an importer who could hook us up with [Kaihara denim](http://www.kaihara-denim.com/english/company/history.html), from a mill dating back to 1893 (!). We then designed, cut, and sewed our first pairs here in Brooklyn, and found that the result was form-fitting but durable, and comfortable to boot.

Of course, these are handmade, "artisinal" quality jeans, so the price went up commeasurately. But we think it's worth it.

The materials and workmanship speak for themselves, and our product photos show them off beautifully. Check it out: [Telegram Jeans](http://telegram-co.com/products/telegram-jeans). Japanese denim, cut and sewn in Brooklyn.
