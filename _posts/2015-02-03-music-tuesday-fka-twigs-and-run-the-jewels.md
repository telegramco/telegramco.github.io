I've been going through Picthfork's [Best of 2014](http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9558-the-50-best-albums-of-2014/5/) and I've got to say, the top two picks are really spot-on.

In a broader sense though, it seems like music reviews are on the decline. Not just because of fewer readers for traditional publications (Rolling Stone, etc.) but also the rise of recommendation engines. When anyone can look up a Spotify playlist or have Pandora make music for you, what's lost?

Especially since not "picking" or reading about or being invested in your own music results in a loss of agency -- if you're not picking the music yourself, you have less at stake, and maybe you care a bit less about what's happening.

These two records are both in a dark, moody, atmospheric vein, and they both have killer style. Graffiti and soul:

If the future's getting darker and grittier, we'll all need darker clothes to catch up.
