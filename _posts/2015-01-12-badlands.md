This is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article on [Badlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_(film)), the 1973 film by Terrence Malick:

"Malick, a protégé of Arthur Penn (whom he thanked in the film's end credits), began work on Badlands after his second year as a student at the American Film Institute. In 1970, Malick, at age 27, began working on the screenplay during a road trip. 'I wrote and, at the same time, developed a kind of sales kit with slides and video tape of actors, all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot,' Malick said. 'To my surprise, they didn't pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith. I raised about half the money and executive producer Edward Pressman the other half.' Malick paid $25,000 of his own funds. The remainder of his share was raised from professionals such as doctors and dentists. Badlands was the first feature film that Malick had written for himself to direct."

Is this a story on faith, or credibility? Malick was, at the time, an unknown director with an unproven product. All he had was a sales kit and a dream, but in a certain sense that's all that matters: he had enough to convince investors that he was ready to take the next step, and they invested.

PS if you haven't seen the movie before, it's [quite good](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NZY6S4/?tag=telegramco-20)
