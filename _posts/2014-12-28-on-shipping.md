If I were to be brutally honest I wouldn't be writing in the first place. Writing is a hard task: you put down words on paper, and others will read it (if you're lucky).

Reading involves an element of judgment: you agree or disagree with the author, or her style, and you decide on-the-spot whether to keep reading or not.

And the same with making music, or art, or (to the more practical-minded) physical products like clothes or iPhones. You want to create a new thing and it's difficult, and you'll catch flak along the way from all angles.

For the most part it comes as doubt, not judgment. Not "that will never work", but "Do you think that will work? Aren't you worried?"

Writing is hard. And music is hard, and art is hard, and making products people care about is hard. But we do it anyway. Why?

Because it's the only work worth doing.
