Most guys have a beaten-up leather jacket in the closet (I've got several), and the best thing about them is that the way they're weathered matches the lifestyle so exactly. There are a few fabrics -- leather and denim mostly -- that conform to your body better the longer  you wear them, and that look better with age than out of the box. A few of our favorites:

- [Rick Owens Stooges](/assets/article_images/2015-02-02/rick-owens-stooges.jpg)

Of course, all of these are hideously expensive. But isn't that what nice things are about? Whenever I waffle about the price of clothing, I think of this quote by Yohji Yamamoto:

> I make clothing like armor. My clothing protects you from unwelcome eyes

And *that* is what good clothing is about.
