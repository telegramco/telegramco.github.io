            </header>
            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/03/19/in-the-now">This article</a> on Karl Lagerfeld gives some revealing tidbits. His extreme work ethic, constant ability to throw everything away, and his impeccable taste contribute the longstanding dominance he&#39;s established at Chanel. He lives like an eighteenth-century aristocrat teleported to the modern day.</p>

<p>On work ethic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until recently, Lagerfeld produced eight collections a year for Chanel (both ready-to-wear and haute couture), five for the Italian luxury label Fendi, and several for labels under his own name—a staggering workload. In 2002, he added an extra Chanel show to his schedule: a high-end ready-to-wear collection designed to profile the work of the Paris métiers d’art, the ateliers that create, by hand, the embroideries, beading, tulle flowers, hats, and shoes on which couture designers rely. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On art:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He shoots the Chanel press kits and catalogues that accompany the collections, as well as fine-art photography, which he periodically displays in galleries. (He recently had a solo exhibition in Berlin.) An avid reader in four languages—English, French, German, and Italian—Lagerfeld also publishes books; his imprint, a division of the German house Steidl, is called Édition 7L, and a few years ago he opened a bookstore, also called 7L, in space adjoining his photo studio, on the Rue Lille. Édition 7L has published forty-one titles, on subjects that range across his many interests, which include (besides fashion and photography) literature, humor, advertising, music, newspapers, mythology, illustration, and architecture. Some of these books have a bracing impracticality: an anthology of the first ten years of the magazine Interview weighed forty-three kilos and was packaged in a wooden trolley of Lagerfeld’s devising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On renewal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I throw everything away!” he declared. “The most important piece of furniture in a house is the garbage can! I keep no archives of my own, no sketches, no photos, no clothes—nothing! I am supposed to do, I’m not supposed to remember!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On taste:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having purchased four apartments on two floors of a two-hundred-year-old building overlooking the Louvre, he is gutting the place and constructing a town house. The upper floor will contain only furniture and art made after the year 2000, including pieces by the Bouroullec brothers, Marc Newson, and others. The lower floor, Lagerfeld says, “is the Old World”; it will feature a large library furnished with pieces from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as from his Art Deco collection. Living in the house will be “like floating in your own spaceship over a very civilized past,” Lagerfeld says.</p>
</blockquote>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p><p>There was great article in the New Yorker recently about the craft of small businesses:
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/small-bountiful-small-business-craft-beer">http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/small-bountiful-small-business-craft-beer</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[S]mall breweries came back. Their beers were not better advertised and certainly not better priced. Rather, the crafts went after an enormous blind spot for the big breweries—namely, flavor. I don’t entirely mean to be snide; more precisely, craft beer succeeded by opting not to compete directly, instead pursuing what can be called a “true differentiation” strategy. That means they established a product that, in the mind of the consumer, is markedly and undeniably different (as opposed to “false differentiation,” which is more or less the same thing with different packaging). True differentiation, if it works, actually changes consumer preferences. The dedicated craft-beer drinker, once he’s hooked, no longer cares if Coors Light costs three dollars less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://telegram-co.com/">Telegram Jeans</a> are getting off the ground, we&#39;d like to think that we&#39;re differentiated in the fact that we&#39;re small. We&#39;re not some big manufacturer or corporate conglomerate. We&#39;re just a few people who care intensely about the product we put out. We care enough about the product that every pair of jeans we put out is handmade, whether you call it &quot;craft&quot; or &quot;small batch&quot; or whatever buzzword you want.</p>

              <p><p>A good pair of jeans is hard to find, because for all the companies that make them, very few put in the legwork for both a very good fit and very fine materials. There are many &quot;expensive&quot; pairs, but there are fewer truly well-made pairs.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://telegram-co.com/">Telegram</a> we&#39;re only doing one cut to start, and that&#39;s a skinny cut made of Japanese denim.</p>

<p>Skinny jeans have been a part the &quot;leading edge&quot; of culture for decades now, and it&#39;s remarkable how well this look has held up. (Especially when paired with a <a href="http://telegramstyle.com/2015/02/02/the-appeal-of-the-beaten-up-leather-jacket.html">nice leather jacket</a> and bedhead-style hair). Let&#39;s recap:</p>

</ul>

<p>Why skinny jeans? Everyone has their own tastes, and natural variation in body proportions mean that cuts from some manufacturers look great on some but hideous on others. But for those of reasonably slim build, a narrow cut fits the bill just right.</p>

<p>One thing we found when designing and cutting our own jeans was that a lot of companies get it wrong. They either make the jean out of very rigid denim (which is too hard to move around in) or very elastic denim (which doesn&#39;t wear as well as pure cotton). For Telegram we looked for a happy medium between these two -- we found an importer who could hook us up with <a href="http://www.kaihara-denim.com/english/company/history.html">Kaihara denim</a>, from a mill dating back to 1893 (!). We then designed, cut, and sewed our first pairs here in Brooklyn, and found that the result was form-fitting but durable, and comfortable to boot.</p>

<p>Of course, these are handmade, &quot;artisinal&quot; quality jeans, so the price went up commeasurately. But we think it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>The materials and workmanship speak for themselves, and our product photos show them off beautifully. Check it out: <a href="http://telegram-co.com/products/telegram-jeans">Telegram Jeans</a>. Japanese denim, cut and sewn in Brooklyn.</p>
