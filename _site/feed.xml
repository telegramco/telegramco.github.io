        <title>How to Make a Living Doing Art</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it take to make a living doing art? There&amp;#39;s this Ira Glass quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course art isn&amp;#39;t just visual art, but anything you make -- if you make music, or write novels, or design clothes or write programs, the sentiment is the same. There&amp;#39;s a sense of &amp;#39;taste&amp;#39; but you have to push past it, to get to what you&amp;#39;re good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterpart to that big quote is Kevin Kelly&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/&quot;&gt;1000 true fans&lt;/a&gt;. The idea that with the rise of the Internet, you don&amp;#39;t need a giant audience or a great big megaphone anymore. You just need a small group of people who care about what you&amp;#39;re making. Who care a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about what you&amp;#39;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is what we&amp;#39;re trying to do with Telegram. We want to make one thing—Japanese denim jeans—and make them very, very well. (Interested? We&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://telegram-co.com&quot;&gt;launching soon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coffee and Motorcycles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a coffee-shop a few blocks away from me that sells two things: coffee, and motorcycles. I&amp;#39;m not kidding -- the coffee is strong, the motorcycles are loud, and the patrons love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the difference between a cup of coffee and a motorcycle? (How is a raven like a writing desk?). You could say it&amp;#39;s a matter of degree, the idea that both create a sense of speed, energy, and rustic individualism. You could even go further, since with a lot of commodities -- coffee, say, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://telegram-co.com&quot;&gt;denim&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s not just about the product, but the story behind it. &amp;quot;A good story will make even the best offer even better,&amp;quot; as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by selling these two things -- a $3 cup of coffee, and a $9000 motorcycle, they seem to make a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only we could all be so cleanly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pen and Paper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How good are your tools?&lt;br&gt;
Are they the best, or the most functional?&lt;br&gt;
Are they simple or complex?&lt;br&gt;
Are they expensive or cheap?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of writing or sketching, my requirements are pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cahier-style notebooks, either by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/8883704983/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Moleskine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IQU75AE/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Muji&lt;/a&gt;. One advantage of living in New York is that there are three or four Muji stores in Manhattan, each with stacks upon stacks of wonderful Japanese stationery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black pens. No other color will do. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DV6EHLS/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Le Pen&lt;/a&gt; for felt-tip, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AQNW3/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Bic Velocity&lt;/a&gt; for ballpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical pencil. Because having to sharpen a pencil is so twentieth-century. I use the simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IEE4/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Sharpwriter&lt;/a&gt;, like you would use in drafting class in grade school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001Q4HQVU/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;artist&amp;#39;s erasers&lt;/a&gt;. Because when you erase something, it should be GONE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also this weird effect where buying nice notebooks seems to increase the quality and quantity of your ideas (&amp;quot;I have this wonderful notebook, now I should fill it with something&amp;quot;), but if the notebook is TOO nice then you never end up writing in it (&amp;quot;This Moleskine cost $20, hell if I&amp;#39;m putting my amateur scratchings in it&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://telegram-co.com/&quot;&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt; these tools gave me great results. The logo, initial concept, details, and fit were all sketched out with mechanical pencil before being drawn &amp;quot;for real&amp;quot; in Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Writing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I were to be brutally honest I wouldn&amp;#39;t be writing in the first place. Writing is a hard task: you put down words on paper, and others will read it (if you&amp;#39;re lucky).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading involves an element of judgment: you agree or disagree with the author, or her style, and you decide on-the-spot whether to keep reading or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same with making music, or art, or (to the more practical-minded) physical products like clothes or iPhones. You want to create a new thing and it&amp;#39;s difficult, and you&amp;#39;ll catch flak along the way from all angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part it comes as doubt, not judgment. Not &amp;quot;that will never work&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;Do you think that will work? Aren&amp;#39;t you worried?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is hard. And music is hard, and art is hard, and making products people care about is hard. But we do it anyway. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s the only work worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wabi-sabi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a book I read recently on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0981484603/?tag=telegramco-20&quot;&gt;Wabi-sabi&lt;/a&gt;. It reflects in itself the philosophy of wabi-sabi: soft cardboard cover, beautifully starched (but imperfect) pages, and a rough-cut edge to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wabi-sabi is the opposite of modernist design. Apple would never allow this kind of imperfection. But it&amp;#39;s a different kind of perfect: the perfect of your grandfather&amp;#39;s pocket-knife, or a motorcycle jacket that&amp;#39;s been ridden across the US and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect that comes from wear. From the kinds of things that get better with time, and not worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An iPhone from three years ago is an old iPhone. A motorcycle jacket from three years ago is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
